        <h2>Description:</h2>

            <p>I’ve always been a fan of classic sloppy joes.  There’s something so innately 
                satisfying about the sweet and savory combination and messiness of it all!  And 
                I know you all love them too, since I’ve been getting a lot of requests for 
                sloppy joe recipes.</p>

            <p>I’ve made a LOT of sloppy joe recipes lately, trying to come up with the perfect 
                one.  Some were too sweet, others too spicy.  Well guys, I finally got it.  The 
                perfect balance.  This sloppy joe recipe is sweet, tangy, zesty and savory, with 
                the perfect texture and consistency.</p>
