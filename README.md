<h1>HTML Foundations Project: Recipes</h1>

    <p>This project consists of a simple webpage that links to other webpages containing recipes.</p>

    <p>This website is built entirely in HTML, and serves as a way to put my HTML skills into practice. I will be using headings, paragraphs, unordered lists, and ordered lists to accomplish this.</p>
